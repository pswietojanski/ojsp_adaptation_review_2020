# Adaptation Algorithms for Neural Network-Based Speech Recognition: An Overview

 Data and scripts used to produce meta-analysis results in our review paper on adaptation algorithms for speech recognition ([IEEE link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9296327), [Arxiv link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06580.pdf)), published in [IEEE Open Journal of Signal Processing](https://signalprocessingsociety.org/publications-resources/ieee-open-journal-signal-processing/about-open-journal-signal-processing).

## On the data

You can find raw meta-analysis data in the `data` directory. These are used in `analysis.ipynb` noteboook to produce aggregated results in (mostly) tabular form (for now). For the paper we directly generated latex plots using `pdfplots` (if you need them, raw sources are also generated by the notebook - they should be in the `/content/figs` Colab directory after you run the notebook, you can also find these in the paper's latex sources on Arxiv).
